# Book App

**Author**: Sally Ammous

**Version**: 1.0.4

## Overview

When entered into the front-end link, this app allows the user to generate the following information about a city they would like to explore:

* Location details
* Weather forecasts
* Hiking trails details
* Movies that are being played nearby
* Yelp reviews for restaurants in the area

## Getting Started

You can run this app yourself by visiting the [City Explorer](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/city-explorer-app/front-end/) front end, entering the link of the app (either the [Heroku app live link](https://murmuring-harbor-73413.herokuapp.com/) or your own localhost link). It is important to note, the front-end doesn't accept HTTP type links, therefore, when entering the link into City Explorer make sure you enter it with a HTTPS prefix and no '/' at the end of the link.
